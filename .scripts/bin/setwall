# Script to set a wallpaper using feh, and ensure that it is set by
# .xinitrc by copying the image into ~/wall
#
# Takes one argument, which can be either a file or a directory.
# 
# If a file is given, it get copied and set as wallpaper.
#
# If a directory is given, it searches for every file with a png, jpg and
# jpeg extension then it will select one at random to copy and set as
# wallpaper.

# This is practically the same as Luke Smith's setbg script that he showed
# on his video: Wallpapers Easily and "Hackably" on Linux. Just without
# pywal or using xwallpaper.
